In the program d1afork.c, the child process is assigned a value of 1.
The fork() command makes it so that the parent and child processes execute concurrently.
This means that since parent is assigned statement 2 and the child is assigned process 1,
the code executes the statements in the order of 2, 1, 3, and 4.
This is because the parent has precedence over the child (even though they technically run concurrently)
and the parent executes its statement before the child.
In the d1bvfork.c program, the child process executes first because the vfork() command lets the child execute
first, and then the parent. This makes the output 1, 2, 3, and 4.
